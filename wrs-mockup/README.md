# Warehouse Receipt System (WRS) Kenya

A modern, user-friendly platform for Kenyan farmers and traders to securely store avocadoes in certified warehouses, receive digital tokens as receipts, and access credit and markets.

---

## 🌍 Business Description

**WRS Kenya** is a digital-native platform designed to revolutionize agricultural post-harvest management in Kenya. We enable farmers, traders, and market players to securely store their produce (starting with avocadoes) in certified warehouses and receive digital tokens (warehouse receipts) as proof of ownership. These tokens can be used as collateral for loans, traded as negotiable instruments, or redeemed for cash/produce, unlocking access to credit and stable markets.

**Problems We Solve:**
- Post-harvest losses due to poor storage
- Limited access to credit for smallholder farmers
- Lack of transparency and trust in produce storage and trading
- Market volatility and price instability

**Target Audience:**
- Smallholder and commercial farmers
- Agricultural cooperatives
- Produce traders and aggregators
- Financial institutions and agri-lenders
- Warehouse operators
